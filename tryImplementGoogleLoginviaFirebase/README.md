For documentation purposes. Tried to implement GoogleSign on for 2 days as a different input method along with a new app lay out. Didn't work out but wanted to add information

Followed a series of Code with Beto videos to try to implement but Google Auth2.0 either failed or wuldn't authorize despite multiple attemys. Believe it could be the emulator delay on android studio windows.
